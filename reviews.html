                    I decided it was time to revisit Ridley Scott's landmark film. And it hit me every bit as hard as
                    the first time I saw it. So here's the question that, even 42 years later, continues to stir through
                    people's minds: what exactly is it that makes ALIEN what it is today?

                    The truth is, it's a tough question to answer, as it's not nearly as action-driven as its sequel,
                    but rather a quiet film that I can't help but compare to a deadly snake slowly crawling up my limbs
                    for two hours. I think fans of this classic can agree that the seemingly effortless combination of
                    that quiet, achingly slow-burning tension along with some terrifying creature/set designs and even a
                    few moments of genuine shocks (I'm not only referring to that infamously horrifying chestburster
                    sequence, which is still a doozy). The cast is uniformly excellent all around, and far more
                    interesting than many of the later films (excluding ALIENS and the surprising PROMETHEUS, which also
                    featured a strong cast). These elements are a major part of why ALIEN has taken its deserved place
                    among cinema's greatest productions.

                    Another thing I loved was the fact that much of the film takes place in a dark, shadowy atmosphere.
                    Then, there's Jerry Goldsmith's sublime and quiet score, and silence is brilliantly used to ramp up
                    the suspense to amazing and terrifying heights.

                    In the film's final act, we see Ripley attempting to escape the Nostromo - and that firestorm of
                    technical creativity and shocking, in-your-face terror could not have been a more perfect way to
                    close this chapter, and set us up for James Cameron's own classic, a sequel which would earn
                    Sigourney Weaver countless deserved accolades, and even an Academy Award nomination for Best
                    Actress. Not many female movie heroines can say that. Overall, the blend of great writing,
                    first-rate performances, amazingly haunting visuals, and a relentless sense of dread and terror that
                    slowly torments your mind and your nerves are what I believe to be the reason ALIEN is a true
                    classic.

                    This movie is probably the director Ridley Scott's finest hour. Not very often do we see a film that
                    is perfect in every department, not only with the choice of director, but the art direction, the
                    music score, visual effects, editing, and acting and many other aspects of the film blend together
                    to produce an incredible piece of movie making. The outer space scenario is perfectly handled with a
                    slow build up suspense of an alien creature with unexpected growth patterns to the first appearance
                    of the fully grown creature that is regarded as one of the most terryfiying and original designs
                    ever in film history. The great thing about this film is that you feel if you are actually there.
                    You become immersed with the set design and can identify each and every one if the characters. This
                    is a flawless classic, with can be viewed many times and still has the potential to scare even to
                    this day. I would give Alien a well deserved 10 out of 10 !!!!!

                    In space no one can hear you scream in this Scifi classic that started it all. At first, I wasn't
                    sue about watching it after I watch Predator and Alien vs. Predator. In the future, a space mining
                    team is en route back to earth until they received a distress signal from another planet. The Crew
                    whichs includes Ripley (Sigourey Weaver), Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Lambert (Veronica
                    Cartwright), Parker (Live and Let Die's Yaphet Kotto), Ash (the Late Ian Holm), Brett (the late
                    Harry Dean Stanton), and Kane (the Late John Hurt) go investigate and come upon a ship. When one of
                    the crew gets something on his face and gives birth to an alien force. The crew must find a way to
                    destroy it before returning to earth. However, one of the crewmembers is secretly hiding something
                    and intends to capture it. This movie is so scary and its a reminder that were not alone in the
                    universe. Some scenes are truly scary like (spoiler alert) the alien bursting out John Hurt's chest,
                    The alien appearing in front of Tom Skerritt, the Alien attacking Harry Dean Stanton and the
                    revealed that Ash was a robot. This is so scary and good, the cast is excellent, the designs were
                    good and also the Xenomorph is an interesting Alien, we would later see it again in other alien
                    movies.
